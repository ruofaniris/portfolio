                <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12">
                Jaunt Inc. is a company dedicating to provide next generation virtual reality cinematic experience. Jaunt VR is their VR movie distribution application, through which users can watch 360° movies and videos. It runs on all mainstream VR platforms including: Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Samsung Gear VR, Google Cardboard and so forth. <br><br>

                During my summer internship at Jaunt as a UX designer, I was assigned to explore design patterns for virtual reality and bold ideas to improve the overall user experience of Jaunt VR.

                “A good VR cinematic experience” is a very abstract and general goal. From the perspective of the company, it’s important for us to know how to measure a good VR cinematic experience from the statistic view by objectifying and decomposing it into several specific reflections.<br><br>

               For Jaunt VR, we break down the general goal into the four key performance indicators(KPI), through which we believe can directly reflect the quality of the experience we provide users with.

                As a new media significantly different from 2D media, virtual reality has a very limited adoption rate among common users, which makes it even more significant for Jaunt VR to understand who the target users are. Based on the user data we have accumulated in the past, three principal persona are generated. The current target users of Jaunt VR tend to fall into one or more following characteristics: <span class="highlight2">young group</span>, <span class="highlight2">technology savoirs</span>, <span class="highlight2">movie/video lovers</span>.

                As the hardware on which the Jaunt VR application runs, the VR devices in the market are increasingly emerging and changing. And different devices can be significantly different from each other. They have different <span class="highlight2">display property</span>, <span class="highlight2">interaction input</span> and <span class="highlight2">degree of freedom</span>(DOF). Since Jaunt VR runs on all mainstream VR platform, it’s important for us to have good understanding of most VR devices and make sure we can provide as good user experience as possible for all of them.

                Facing all of the significantly different VR device, we categorize them into several main types mainly based on interaction input. Then, we follow the <span class="highlight2">bottom-up</span> design principle, which is designing a basic version of our application referring to the lowest end VR headset (google cardboard), based on which we customize our application for different higher end device. Because the lowest end device is also the most accessible and widely adopted device, thus the biggest market.

              <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12">
                Ideally, in virtual reality, the user should be able to freely and comfortably explore the 360° virtual environment surrounding them, through which a strong immersiveness could be created. Normally, looking around is achieved through the combination of a person’s body rotation and head yawing.
              </p>

              <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12">
                However, in practical case, various constraints may not allow a user to comfortably make large movements.Thus, for use case in virtual reality, one of the most important factor differentiate one case from another is the <span class="highlight2">movement freedom/comfort</span> of the physical status the user is at. Because the movement freedom will directly influence a user’s intuitive behavior in virtual reality and bring up corresponding physical feedback. To understand our design constraints, we have to look into different use cases. Through our investigation, the use case of Jaunt VR are categorized into three types.

              <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12">
                Through use case analysis, we found that a large number of users using virtual reality applications suffering from a certain degree of movement constraints. For those with less constraints, it could still be exhausting to make too much movement. The meaningful insight we extracted from that is to wisely layout our user interface and reduce unnecessary movement of the user.

The most sticky experience always relates to social elements, which increase motivation of a single individual and create the sense of community.</p>

Immersiveness makes users want not only passive watching but to interact with it, which also matches Jaunt's vision, to create interactive movie experience.</p>

               Unlike traditional 2D design on the screen, virtual reality follows a very different user experience pattern called <span class="highlight1">Spatial UX</span>. In virtual reality, user’s experience is closely associated with ergonomical factors including: field of view, head movement range, canvas distance and UI size.

               For most VR experience, usage of VR devices happens when sitting in a fixed chair. Thus, accommodating with the comfortable <span class="highlight1">Range of Head Motion</span> (pitch, yaw & roll) and prioritizing UI elements accordingly are significant to a comfortable and efficient VR experience.

               As in 2D media, the size of text has to be carefully chosen to maintain its legibility. In VR,  font size or the font height directly relates to its relative distance from eyes, pixels per degree (ppd) of the screen and the number of pixels you assign to the text.

               The Jaunt VR application consists of different scenes. Following the ergonomic guidance, I designed a new category lobby scene and redesigned the preview scene for Jaunt VR. The size and distance of all UI elements in the two scenes are decided by ergonomic calculation and rounds of user test. To maximize the iteration efficiency, the design progress of each scene follows a three-step process as follow.

                In the stage of 2D wireframe, the basic information architecture and UI layout will be decided on paper in the form of wireframe. After that, we will build corresponding simple 3D user interface using 3D modeling tools, during which we will continuously adjust the size, distance and angles of all UI elements following the ergonomic rules through rounds of user test. In the end, a rendered scene with beautiful environment, color palette and textures will be made using both 3D modeling software and 3D game engine.

              <h2>Socialization & Interaction</h2>

                <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12">
                Other than ergonomics, the other two important aspects of my solution are to bring <span class="highlight2">social</span> and <span class="highlight2">interactive</span> elements into Jaunt VR. The solution enables users to have a collective VR movie experience and to interact with certain objects(scenes) of the movie. <br>However, due to <span class="highlight2">NDA</span>, I am not able to share details about this part of my work here. If you are interested, please contact me directly.<br><br>

                The ultimate goal of virtual reality movie is to create a virtual cinematic world in which audience can become a part of the movie's narrative without being able to tell it from reality. Just like how it's described in the HBO series "West World". It may not be able to come true in three or five years, but we believe that, to make a VR movie interactive and to connect users in it is a big step towards it.
